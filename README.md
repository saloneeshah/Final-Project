# Title: Goalkeeper Success Rate Simulation

## Team Member(s): Claire Wu|Salonee Shah|Samuel John

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
The program would simulate the success percentage of a goalkeeper for using different strategies over a number of penalty attempts The game would be simulated based on various methods while using a dataset such as the penalty dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/apopov41/exploring-penalty-kick-variables/data

Each kick simulated would be a random row picked from the dataset and the direction of kick and leg used would be used in the program. The simulation conditions we are considering are: 
•	Goalie jumps in a random direction for each opponent over a set number of runs 
•	Goalie jumps in the direction the opponents most frequently shoot in for a set number of runs 
•	Goalie considers the opponents' shot direction as well as the foot used for the shot (data obtained from the previous scenario) to determine which direction to jump in a set number of runs

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
